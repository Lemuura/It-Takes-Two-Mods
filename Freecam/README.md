# Installation guide:

1)  Locate the installation folder for It Takes Two
	You can easily do this in steam by right clicking the game -> Manage -> Browse Local Files

2)  Go into the Nuts folder, and backup the Script folder elsewhere
	
3)  Drag and drop the downloaded "Script" folder into the Nuts folder for It Takes Two, click replace on all

4)  Go into the Script folder, and move PrecompiledScript.Cache elsehwere. I usually just make a new folder called "PrecompiledScript" and throw it in there

5)  Launch the game with -devmenu as a launch argument

6)  Tadaa, you're all done! You can now access the freecam tools in the Functions menu in the Devmenu :)

If you want to launch the game without any of the modifications, just drag the PrecompiledScript.Cache file back into the Script folder

# Uninstall:

1) Delete the Mods folder inside the Script folder

2) Find your Script folder backup, and replace all files

3) If you don't have a backup, verify the integrity of the game files through steam or repair game files through Origin
